### To Do

- select a model 
- more info for selected model  
- Nav bar
- load data from JSON
- (resolve hard coding with a basic manager tab) 

### Plans

- leave the front page as it is (hardcoded)
- phone selected
    * change back to having a main phone
        1 change it when new model is selected
        2 update list on the right (append first to the end)
    * more -> list on the right => more information of the phone (more -> less) and vice-versa
